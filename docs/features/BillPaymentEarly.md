# Bill Payment - Early

Pay your bills early and enjoy the rewards!

### Earn Parking Dates

When you pay your bills early, you get the opportunity to earn parking dates. By taking care of your bills ahead of time, you can free up your schedule and enjoy some well-deserved time off without worrying about pending payments.

### Beat Your Saving Account Interest

By paying your bills early, you can potentially beat the interest earned on your savings account. Instead of keeping your funds in a low-interest savings account, why not use them to settle your bills in advance and save on potential interest charges? It's a smart financial move that can help you maximize your savings.
