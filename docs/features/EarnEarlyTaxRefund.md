# Earn Early Tax Refund

Access your tax refund early on a monthly basis, without having to wait for your tax return.

### No Bill, No Customer Reward/Fee

With this option, there are no bills or customer rewards/fees involved. Instead, the focus is solely on providing early tax refunds.

### Simple Process

Follow these steps to earn your early tax refund:

1. Link your bank account with Pay Stack.
2. Upload your past tax returns for verification.
3. Pay Stack verifies your tax returns with tax consultants.
4. Receive your tax refund directly into your linked bank account, without waiting for the usual processing time.

### Withdrawal Option

If you prefer to receive the tax refund as a withdrawal, you have the following option:

1. Request a withdrawal of your eligible tax refund amount.
2. Pay Stack internally obtains a loan from a bank to provide you with the withdrawal amount.
3. Repay the loan to Pay Stack, and Pay Stack repays the bank.

By offering early tax refunds, Pay Stack ensures that you have access to your tax refund funds when you need them most.
