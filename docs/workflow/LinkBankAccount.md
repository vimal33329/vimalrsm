# Link Bank Account

To start using Pay Stack features, users must link their bank account. Please follow the steps below:

### Step 1: Create Customer

Using the [Create Customer API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/11339178/2s93eYUsLS#a6122a6d-dfc8-4a0c-9081-6cbd24ec26f3), create a customer account. This will generate a unique Customer ID for the user.

### Step 2: Link Bank Account and KYC

Using the Customer ID obtained from Step 1, proceed to link the bank account and complete the KYC (Know Your Customer) process. This step verifies the user's identity and financial information.

For a sample login flow, you can refer to this [link](https://pay-management.psvimal33329.workers.dev/Materlogin).

Once the above process is completed successfully, you will be able to access the user's bank data.
