## 02/2022 - Present

A form builder is a software tool or framework that simplifies the process of creating and managing web forms. It provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to design and customize forms without the need for coding or technical expertise.

With a form builder, users can drag and drop form elements such as text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, dropdown menus, and more, onto a canvas. They can then configure the properties and settings of each form element, including validation rules, default values, and conditional logic.

Form builders typically offer a wide range of customization options, allowing users to style the forms according to their branding guidelines. They may provide themes, templates, or CSS customization options to achieve a desired visual appearance.

Form builders also often integrate with backend systems or third-party services, enabling seamless data collection and processing. This may involve integrating with databases to store form submissions, connecting with email marketing services to send automated responses, or integrating with payment gateways to process transactions.

Overall, a form builder simplifies and streamlines the process of creating and managing web forms, making it accessible to users with varying technical skills. It saves time and effort by eliminating the need for manual coding and provides a user-friendly interface for designing forms that can be embedded into websites or used independently.
